This directory contains data used in the spliceosome analysis.

- *_spliceosome_variants_for_VEP.txt.gz are input files to be run through Ensembl's VEP.

- *_spliceosome_variants.txt.gz are the output files from VEP.

Note that the archaic-specific files reflect archaic-specific variants, whereas the lineage-specific files include all variants present in that individual's genome. The former files were compared with the average number of missense variants in the 24 randomly sampled 1KG individuals.
