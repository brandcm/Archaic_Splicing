This directory contains data files used as inputs for analysis as well as the outputs from several analyses. Due to space constraints, a handful of files are absent here. These mostly include large data files such as VCFs. I have attempted to note this where possible but please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions. Many of the other files are gzipped to save space. To decompress use the following command: `gzip -d`.
