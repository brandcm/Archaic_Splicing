This directory contains the input used to determine introgressed variants.

- sorted_no_dups_archaic_introgressed_tag_snps.bed.gz is a concatenation of the ASN, EUR, PNG, and SAS tag SNP files (retrieved from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9Pc7_zItMCVM05rUmhDc0hkWmc?resourcekey=0-zwKyJGRuooD9bWPRZ0vBzQ). Duplicate entries that resulted from merging data for multiple populations were removed. We used the all_tag_snps.*.merged.ALL.0.3_R2_cluster.1KG_phase3_essentials.bed set of files.
