This directory contains the list of genes with >= 1 splice altering variant (SAV) at two maximum delta thresholds (>= 0.2 and >= 0.5), which is denoted in the file name (_2 >= 0.2 and _5 >= 0.5). Genes with multiple entries in a given file reflect the number of SAVs in that gene. Duplicate entries can be easily removed using the Linux command-line utility uniq. Gene annotations are from GENCODE, Human Release 24 for hg19/GRCh37 (Harrow et al. 2012).
