This directory contains the gene lists for nine sets of archaic SAVs. These lists are identical to those found in the [genes directory](https://github.com/brandcm/Archaic_Splicing/tree/main/data/genes) for delta $\geq$ 0.2. One necessary input file is missing from this directory due to it's size: archaic_data_for_enrichment.txt. However, this file is generated in the [analysis notebook](https://github.com/brandcm/Archaic_Splicing/blob/main/scripts/notebooks/5_analysis.ipynb). Alternatively, the file can be created by retrieving the main data file from [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.7272/Q6H993F9) and subsetting the delta_max, annotation, distribution, Vernot_allele_origin, and Browning_allele_origin fields with the header.
